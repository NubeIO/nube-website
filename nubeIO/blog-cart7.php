                        <p>
                            Nube iO recently partnered with the University of Wollongong’s SMART Infrastructure Facility and Devika to produce a 3D virtual model of the digital living lab utilising Nube iO’s smart sensors. The collaboration involved installing 120 of our smart sensor Droplets into each room in the building, to monitor features of the built environment in real time such as temperature, humidity, light and motion.                         
                        </p>
                        <img src="images/SMART-1.png" alt="">
                        <p>
                            The droplet is a LoRa-enabled battery-operated environmental sensor, built to address the problem of wanting multiple points of data capture with minimal time for install and wiring. LoRa wireless technology requires less power and is more reliable in communicating information to the receiver than regular WiFi.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Nube droplets can be easily installed on any surface to collect multiple data points. The receiver, in turn, aggregates, interprets, and then sends this information over to a local server or the cloud.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Nube’s technology was combined with virtual reality technology supplied by Devika, which produced the 3D model allowing users to interact with the virtual environment and view the results from smart sensors in real time.

                            SMART’s director, Senior Professor Pascal Perez says “SMART, Nube iO and Devika pulled their resources together to share their R&D capabilities and design a cost effective solution that is both sustainable and scalable. The SMART Infrastructure Facility has now become a truly smart building.” 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In the future, Perez hopes to utilise the technology to monitor occupancy patterns to optimise energy usage, as well as control air conditioning and ventilation systems.

                        <p>
                            A major benefit of using Nube iO technology for buildings of this size is that unlike traditional monitoring systems, our sensors can be deployed within a matter of days. As the droplet is completely wireless, there are no complications of wiring or lengthy installation processes. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This collaboration has shown the potential for Nube iO to be used in isolation as well as demonstrating interoperability with other technology. We hope to work on other smart city projects with many industries in the future.                        
                       </p>
